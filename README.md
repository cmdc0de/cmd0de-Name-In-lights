ATTiny13 + 60 APA104s + my New voltera one
* ensure you use the DRC file that voltera provides and is checked into this repo


ATTiny13a + 60 APA104s + Bantam Tool PCB Mill
* I just used my voltera DRC but the mill can go with smaller closer traces
* Remember to increase the isolation otherwise solider will bridge given a space of only 10 mils between traces
* I used my Voltera to solider and reflow the board after the bantam mill, milled the board


Arduino base code thanks to:  https://wp.josh.com/2014/05/13/ws2812-neopixels-are-not-so-finicky-once-you-get-to-know-them/

To program ATTiny13a I used the public doc from instructables check into this repo.
